# Taking the Leap
It's funny how clear hindsight really is. Looking back, I see so many signs that 
my real interests lie in software. I mean, of course I did realize that, but the
idea that I should (or even could) pursue it as a career just didn't surface. 
After all, I was investing everything I had in a career in mechanical engineering.

My first co-op position was slow. Like, really slow. The kind of slow where I was 
given two weeks to complete a task that took two days. Then when I asked for more 
work, there just wasn't any. You'd think a mechanical engineering student would 
spend his time reading about something mechanical, but not me. I spent the majority 
of my free time that summer learning all things Linux. It was super cool to me... 
everything was *there*, I could open up anything to see how it worked, I could 
set up servers for funsies, and, very importantly for a struggling student, all 
it costed was time. My first Linux install was Mandrake, circa 2003, and I haven't
looked back since.

This trend continued throughout the rest of my university career. The next co-op 
placement I was experimenting with setting up and running servers of all sorts. 
I played with web, mail, sftp, etc. I learned a bit of PHP to build an image 
sharing site with my friends. I bricked my machine for a few days trying to 
compile a custom kernel. Good times.

The thing is, at least in university there is a computational component 
in any engineering field these days. I was getting my code fix writing Matlab 
scripts and the like. In grad school and my research career, it was LabVIEW, 
image processing, and SQL. The problem is, most actual jobs are not like that. 
Entering the workforce, I guess what surprised me the most was just how 
non-technical most engineering jobs were. Sure, we run calculations, but mostly 
we're just feeding inputs into a software suite that does all the work; we're 
glorified data entry clerks. I was far more interested in *building that software 
suite* than I was in using it. And so that's exactly what I started doing; first
for smaller tasks but eventually growing into things I used on a daily basis
(see my Calculators SPA repo for an example).

The thought of switching to a career writing software has been on my mind for 
the last couple years, so I've been trying to shore up my knowledge and skills 
by going through tutorials and open courses. I found the courses on Lynda.com 
were pretty good for teaching skills, and MIT open courseware (ocw.mit.edu) is
great for learning theory (I'm just finishing up 6.034 Artificial Intelligence 
at the time of this writing). What I need now is more real-world experience; I
am ready to take this software thing full-time.
